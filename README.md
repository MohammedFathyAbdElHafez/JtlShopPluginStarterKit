# JtlShopPluginStarterKit

## Introduction

- this starter kite inspired by Laravel framework and mvc pattern.
- it's wrap for JtlShop built in classes.
- why I started building this kit because of the following:-
- what I saw in the documentation was not clear enough for any developers whom used to code in modern pattern.
- if the plugin require a lot of logic based on demos of jtl on gitlab where writing the whole logic in bootstrap file which isn't clean and would be hard to be maintained by the time.
- last thing I build it clean and separate as possible based on my knowledge of any one knows to do it better im really open for it.

## Prerequisite

1. php >= 7.4

## Guidelines

- src directory the where the developer will write his logic based on the plugin  requirements.
- for database we have to main directories
    1. migrations
        - Here we create table with it's columns which will create our tables
        - has migrations directory which contains the tables that will be created on the database when the plugin will be enabled 
        - all the developer has to do is just create new php file following the example in the migrations directory with the same code styling if table columns data type not supported he have to add the new type into the Initialization/Table class 
        then it will be allowed to use in his migration file.
    1. models
        - Here we create models
        - has main class which is model which hold all basic queries for table insert/update/delete/select/order By/paginate and if the plugin require more advanced queries he have to add it 
        - will make his models which is refer to the table and columns he need to query on it the model have to extend the model class he can use it on created table by the migration or on existing table of the project.

- Request directory

  - Here we create request validation rules 
  - Storing Data via post request
  - first from has to be contains jtl token via {$jtl_token} to pass middleware verification
